# Project 2 - Touring Camper

### Problem:

I am passionate about camping and I want an app for camping with reviews from real people

### General App Idea/Purpose:

Website that allows people to see cool places to camp with reviews from real people.

### Who Would Use It:

Camping enthusiasts

## The Website

TBD - via Heroku

## Notes

### - Used PUG module instead of EJS, at least for now. Issues with EJS. PUB is waay easier.

### - MapBox API - don't know if it's going to work

### - Routes w/ Postman
